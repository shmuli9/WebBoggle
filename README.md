# WebBoggle

#### The aim of this application is to solve the board game Boggle(TM)

My solution recursively searches the entire board, but significant speed optimisiations were achived by pruning search branches with the use of a prepared dictionary, built with a linked-list type data structure (not quite a linked list as the data structure looks like `WTNode{data: str, isWord: boolean, children ={"A" : nodeA, "B": nodeB, ...}}`)

WordTree generation, consisting of 279,496 words, takes consistently under 2s, usually 1.85s. Note, this is done once per application run, not once per Board.
Typical Board search speed on my laptop (CPU: i7-8550u, SSD, RAM: 16GB) is in the region of **1-7ms**
Over a 10,000 boards, the average speed was 1.67ms, max 7.999ms, min 0.0ms(ie, too small for python to count)
